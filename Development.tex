This project has been developed using the Kanban-methodology which is a lean (and agile) development methodology


This project has been developed using a Kanban. Kanban is a Lean software development methodology with five core principles:
Vizualize work flow 
Limit work in progress 
Manage flow
Make process policies explicite
Improve collaboration

At the start of the project we made a backlog of User Stories. We used an electronic kanban board from Kanbanpad.com to visualize the work flow. Through the development we split the stories into smaller development tasks and posted on the kanban board. This helped us limit the work in progress because we would finish a task before starting a new one. (See attachments for screenshots from the kanban board).
