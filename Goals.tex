In this section we will present the goals and secondary goals of our project.

Our main goal for FeedJam is to explore novel ways of deploying ranking algorithms, namely PageRank, and novel layouts in order to ease reading of large collections of Tweets. This goal can be split into several components:

\begin{description}
  \item[Twitter API:] Connect to and use the Twitter API.
  \item[Ranking algorithm:] Implement a ranking algorithm, for instance PageRank.
  \item[Novel presentation:] Create and implement a novel way of displaying tweets.
\end{description}

In addition to the main goals there are several things which we wish to explore. These are our secondary goals:

\begin{description}
  \item[PageRank:] We wish to explore if the PageRank algorithm works within the context of Twitter.
  \item[Spring:] We wish to create a web application with the Spring framework.
  \item[AJAX in Spring:] Explore the possibility of using AJAX combined with the Spring framework.
  \item[Caching:] Implement caching for applicable items from the Twitter API.
  \item[User evaluation:] Evaluate the resulting web application.
\end{description}
