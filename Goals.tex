The goal of this project is to learn more about how ranking of results and the presentation of them effects the a user's perception of the search engine. The domain of our project will be Twitter. We will try to make an application that presents Tweets in way that makes it easier for users to see what Tweets are interesting/important and which are not. 

{\bf Explore a novel presentation of information}\newline


{\bf Implement a ranking algorithm}\newline
In order for users to easily see what Tweets are important or interesting we wish to implement a ranking algorithm. Even though the perception of what's important is subjective a general opinion is an indication of what's important. We want to implement the Google PageRank algorithm on Twitter users.

Secondary goals: caching, user evaluation

{\bf Programming}\newline
