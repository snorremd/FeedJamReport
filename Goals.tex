In this section we will present the goals and secondary goals of our project.

Our main goal for FeedJam is to explore novel ways of deploying ranking algorithms, namely PageRank, and novel layouts in order to ease reading of large collections of Tweets. This goal can be split into several components:

\begin{description}
  \item[Twitter API:] Connect to and use the Twitter API.
  \item[Ranking algorithm:] Implement a ranking algorithm, for instance PageRank.
  \item[Novel presentation:] Create and implement a novel way of displaying tweets.
\end{description}

In addition to the main goals there are several things which we wish to explore. These are our secondary goals:

\begin{description}
  \item[PageRank:] We wish to explore if the PageRank algorithm works within the context of Twitter.
  \item[Spring:] We wish to create a web application with the Spring framework.
  \item[AJAX in Spring:] Explore the possibility of using AJAX combined with the Spring framework.
  \item[Caching:] Implement caching for applicable items from the Twitter API.
  \item[User evaluation:] Evaluate the resulting web application.
\end{description}

\subsection{Motivation} %lisa
%personlig: sociale media er i winden. det vil være inteeressant å  gjøre noe med ir for sosiale medier.
The personal motivation for doing this assignment is that we got the chance to acquire new programming skills. We feel it is easier and more inspiring to learn about techniques in information retrieval field when we can use the theories in a practical sense. Twitter was chosen as a domain because social media and microbloging is a poplar research field. And we wanted to explore their API and see if we could make some interesting and enhance the application using theories from the information retrieval field. 

%faglig: lære mer om hvordan søkemotorer ranker ting, presentasjon. Lære med om verktøy som brukes. Er det et behov for å gjøre dette?
PageRank has been a great success on the web through Google. The scientific motivation is to see if the algorithm and a new way of presenting search results will make it easier to get a quick overview of what tweets in the feed are important.
