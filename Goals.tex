{\bf Explore a novel presentation of information}\newline



{\bf Implement a ranking algorithm}\newline %
In order for users to easily see what Tweets are important or interesting we wish to implement a ranking algorithm. Even though the perception of what's important is subjective a general opinion is an indication of what's important. We want to implement the Google PageRank algorithm on Twitter users.

Secondary goals: caching, user evaluation
