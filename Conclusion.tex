Through our work we have been able to implement a new novel way of displaying tweets, utilising information retrieval techniques and algorithms to differentiate between tweets. The application, which at the time of writing can be accessed at http://feedjam.thunemedia.no, was developed and deployed using modern frameworks, techniques and tools.

Through our work on the FeedJam application we experienced how severely limited the fucking Twitter API is.

managed to implement pagerank
- but limited server capacity
- Twitter too connected

managed to create a novel interface

had many problems related to the twitter api

no precision evaluation due to pagerank/server capaciy problems
